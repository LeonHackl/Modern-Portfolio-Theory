# Modern Portfolio Theory
## Introduction
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return 
based on a given level of market risk. Harry Markowitz pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection" which was 
published in the Journal of Finance in 1952. He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on MPT. In this project, we want to
use Markowitz' MPT for identification of optimal portfolios consisting of various crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
